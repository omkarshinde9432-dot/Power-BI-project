## 📈 Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop an end-to-end business intelligence solution using Power BI. 
The OTIF Performance Dashboard highlights my skills in building data models, writing DAX measures, creating drill-downs, 
and designing intuitive dashboards that support real supply chain decision-making.

It reflects hands-on experience in:
✔ Translating business KPIs into visual insights  
✔ Developing scalable and optimized semantic models  
✔ Using DAX to create accurate metric calculations  
✔ Implementing drill-down hierarchies for deeper analysis  
✔ Delivering a polished, user-friendly reporting experience
